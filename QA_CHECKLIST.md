# ðŸ”§ CRITICAL BUG FIXES - QA CHECKLIST

## âœ… STATUS PAGE FIXES

### 1. "People Ahead" Calculation
- [ ] **Test Case**: User with A008, serving A005 â†’ shows "3 people ahead"
- [ ] **Test Case**: User with A001, serving A001 â†’ shows "0 people ahead" 
- [ ] **Test Case**: User with A015, serving A020 â†’ shows "0 people ahead" (no negative)
- [ ] **Real-time**: Updates within 2 seconds when counter calls next number
- [ ] **Formula**: `peopleAhead = Math.max(0, issuedCount - nowServingNum)`

### 2. Estimated Wait Time
- [ ] **Test Case**: 3 people ahead, 60s avg â†’ shows "3 min"
- [ ] **Test Case**: 1 person ahead, 60s avg â†’ shows "1 min"
- [ ] **Test Case**: 0 people ahead â†’ shows "<1 min"
- [ ] **Real-time**: Updates when people ahead count changes
- [ ] **Formula**: `estSeconds = peopleAhead * averageServiceTime`

### 3. Firebase Listeners
- [ ] **Issued Numbers**: Listens to `queues/{prefix}/issuedNumbers`
- [ ] **Current Serving**: Listens to `queues/{prefix}/currentServing`
- [ ] **Average Time**: Listens to `settings/averageServiceTime`
- [ ] **Unified Serving**: Listens to `queue/currentServing` for cross-prefix updates
- [ ] **Updates**: All changes reflect within 2 seconds

## âœ… COUNTER PANEL FIXES

### 4. Real-time Synchronization
- [ ] **Call Next**: Updates both prefix-specific and unified serving numbers
- [ ] **Skip**: Same as call next (increments serving number)
- [ ] **Jump**: Validates number exists before jumping
- [ ] **Set Counter**: Updates counter settings and applies to queue
- [ ] **Validation**: Prevents calling numbers that haven't been issued

### 5. Success/Error Toasts
- [ ] **Success**: "Serving updated successfully" (green)
- [ ] **Error**: "Invalid â€“ number not yet issued" (red)
- [ ] **Error**: "Please select a counter first" (red)
- [ ] **Error**: "Invalid number format" (red)
- [ ] **Auto-hide**: Toasts disappear after 3 seconds

### 6. Counter Management
- [ ] **Add Counter**: Creates new counter with unique prefix
- [ ] **Edit Counter**: Updates name, prefix, start number
- [ ] **Delete Counter**: Removes counter with confirmation
- [ ] **Prefix Conflict**: Prevents duplicate prefixes
- [ ] **Real-time**: Changes sync across all clients

## âœ… ADMIN PANEL FIXES

### 7. Analytics (Read-only)
- [ ] **Today Served**: Shows total served across all prefixes
- [ ] **In Queue**: Shows total people waiting across all prefixes
- [ ] **Real-time**: Updates when queue status changes
- [ ] **No Queue Control**: Admin cannot modify serving numbers

### 8. Counter Management (View/Edit)
- [ ] **View Counters**: Shows all counters with current status
- [ ] **Edit Names**: Can change counter names
- [ ] **Edit Prefixes**: Can change prefixes (with conflict prevention)
- [ ] **Delete Counters**: Can remove counters
- [ ] **No Queue Control**: Cannot set serving numbers

## âœ… CROSS-SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### 9. Multi-Prefix Support
- [ ] **Counter A**: Issues A001, A002, A003...
- [ ] **Counter B**: Issues B001, B002, B003...
- [ ] **Independent**: Each counter operates independently
- [ ] **Unified Display**: All show in unified `queue/currentServing`

### 10. Real-time Updates
- [ ] **Status Page**: Updates when any counter changes
- [ ] **Counter Panel**: Updates when other counters change
- [ ] **Admin Panel**: Updates when any queue changes
- [ ] **Speed**: All updates within 2 seconds
- [ ] **Consistency**: All clients show same data

## âœ… ERROR HANDLING

### 11. Validation
- [ ] **Invalid Calls**: Cannot call numbers not yet issued
- [ ] **Invalid Jumps**: Cannot jump to non-existent numbers
- [ ] **Prefix Conflicts**: Cannot create duplicate prefixes
- [ ] **Format Validation**: Numbers must be valid format
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: System works with missing data

### 12. Edge Cases
- [ ] **No Counters**: System handles empty counter list
- [ ] **No Queue Data**: System initializes with defaults
- [ ] **Network Issues**: System works with Firebase offline
- [ ] **Invalid Data**: System handles corrupted data gracefully
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: System prevents concurrent updates

## ðŸ§ª TESTING SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Basic Queue Flow
1. [ ] Generate number A005 on home page
2. [ ] Check status page shows "A005" and "0 people ahead"
3. [ ] Counter calls next (A001) â†’ status shows "4 people ahead"
4. [ ] Counter calls next (A002) â†’ status shows "3 people ahead"
5. [ ] Counter calls next (A005) â†’ status shows "0 people ahead" and triggers turn

### Scenario 2: Multi-Counter Flow
1. [ ] Admin creates Counter A and Counter B
2. [ ] Counter A issues A001, A002, A003
3. [ ] Counter B issues B001, B002
4. [ ] Counter A serves A001 â†’ unified shows "A001"
5. [ ] Counter B serves B001 â†’ unified shows "B001"
6. [ ] Both operate independently

### Scenario 3: Error Handling
1. [ ] Try to call A010 when only A005 issued â†’ shows error
2. [ ] Try to jump to A999 â†’ shows error
3. [ ] Try to create duplicate prefix â†’ shows error
4. [ ] Try to use invalid number format â†’ shows error

### Scenario 4: Real-time Sync
1. [ ] Open status page on device 1
2. [ ] Open counter panel on device 2
3. [ ] Counter calls next â†’ status updates within 2 seconds
4. [ ] Counter changes prefix â†’ status updates immediately
5. [ ] Admin changes settings â†’ all clients update

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] **All calculations are accurate** (people ahead, wait time)
- [ ] **All updates are real-time** (within 2 seconds)
- [ ] **All validations work** (prevent invalid actions)
- [ ] **All error messages are clear** (user-friendly)
- [ ] **All systems are synchronized** (consistent data)
- [ ] **No console errors** (clean operation)
- [ ] **No NaN or undefined values** (proper data handling)
- [ ] **System is production-ready** (stable and reliable)

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Test on multiple devices simultaneously
- [ ] Test with slow network conditions
- [ ] Test with Firebase offline mode
- [ ] Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test with mobile devices
- [ ] Verify all Firebase rules are correct
- [ ] Backup current data before deployment
- [ ] Monitor system performance after deployment
